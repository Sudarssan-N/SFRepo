    Annual Infrastructure Cost with Customer Interactions:
        Base On-Prem Infrastructure Cost: $6,920,000/year.
        Additional Cost for Customer Interaction: $2,000,000/year.
        Total Infrastructure Cost: $6,920,000 + $2,000,000 = $8,920,000/year.

    Time Saved per Year:
        Developers:
            Minimum: (50 call-outs × 0.5 minutes) × 260 days / 60 = 108.33 hours/year per developer.
            Maximum: (50 call-outs × 1 minute) × 260 days / 60 = 216.67 hours/year per developer.
        Bankers:
            Minimum: (20 call-outs × 0.5 minutes) × 260 days / 60 = 43.33 hours/year per banker.
            Maximum: (20 call-outs × 1 minute) × 260 days / 60 = 86.67 hours/year per banker.

    Annual Cost Savings:
        Developers:
            Minimum Savings: $115.38 × 108.33 × 13,000 = $162,531,692/year.
            Maximum Savings: $115.38 × 216.67 × 13,000 = $325,063,384/year.
        Bankers:
            Minimum Savings: $230.77 × 43.33 × 22,000 = $219,759,708/year.
            Maximum Savings: $230.77 × 86.67 × 22,000 = $439,519,416/year.

    Total Cost Saved Annually:
        Minimum Savings: $162,531,692 (developers) + $219,759,708 (bankers) = $382,291,400/year.
        Maximum Savings: $325,063,384 (developers) + $439,519,416 (bankers) = $764,582,800/year.

    Net Savings:
        Net Savings (Min Estimate): $382,291,400 - $8,920,000 = $373,371,400/year.
