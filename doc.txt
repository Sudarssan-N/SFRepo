Step-by-Step Updated Calculations:

    Number of Call-Outs Per Year:
        Developers: 169,000,000 call-outs/year.
        Employees: 1,159,600,000 call-outs/year.
        Total Annual Call-Outs: 1,328,600,000 call-outs/year.

    Annual Infrastructure Cost:
        On-Premise Models: Assumed to have negligible additional API cost. The focus is on operational costs, which are not detailed here.
        Annual API Infrastructure Cost: $0 (as on-prem models are used).

    Daily Salary:
        Developers and Employees: $230.77/day (as before).

    Updated Time Saved and Cost Savings:

        Time Saved per Search: 2 to 3 minutes.

        Time Saved per Day (in hours):
            Developers: 50 searches × (2 to 3 minutes) = 100 to 150 minutes = 1.67 to 2.5 hours/day.
            Other Employees: 20 searches × (2 to 3 minutes) = 40 to 60 minutes = 0.67 to 1 hour/day.

        Annual Time Saved (in hours):
            Developers: 1.67 to 2.5 hours/day × 260 days = 433.42 to 650 hours/year per developer.
            Employees: 0.67 to 1 hour/day × 260 days = 173.42 to 260 hours/year per employee.

        Annual Cost Savings:
            Developers:
                Minimum Savings: $230.77 × 433.42 × 13,000 = $1,303,267,454/year.
                Maximum Savings: $230.77 × 650 × 13,000 = $1,954,616,500/year.
            Employees:
                Minimum Savings: $230.77 × 173.42 × 223,000 = $8,933,105,342/year.
                Maximum Savings: $230.77 × 260 × 223,000 = $13,408,646,200/year.

    Total Cost Saved Annually:
        Minimum Savings: $1,303,267,454 (developers) + $8,933,105,342 (employees) = $10,236,372,796/year.
        Maximum Savings: $1,954,616,500 (developers) + $13,408,646,200 (employees) = $15,363,262,700/year.

    Net Savings:
        Net Savings (Min Estimate): $10,236,372,796/year.
        Net Savings (Max Estimate): $15,363,262,700/year.
